# diamond2potato
A WIP mod that serves as nothing useful, really.

I'll write more when the mod gets to that point.

**DO NOT USE THIS ON LIVE SERVERS**, there is a command (/opme) that bypasses all permission checks and immediately sets the caller as op. This will _probably_ be removed once this mod is far enough in development to be worth anything.
